# TODO
1.  Invert parameters for reminder, so the description can be as long as the user wants.
2.  Remove the reminder from file, cache and chrono once it has been sent.
3.  Add default reactions for delaying 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 1d, 1w, 1M, 1y
4.  Make it so no more reactions can be added.
5.  Listen to reactions on the messgage for 5mins
6.  If reaction was from the original user, create new reminder for selected time.
7.  [Use Browserify](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html#browserify)
8.  Create branch `dev` to test code on it.
9.  Upload to Heroku and sync with branch `main`.
10.  Comment code
11.  Understand datatimes like '202102171410' but also '2102171410', '02171410', '171410', '1410'
12.  Add new possible inputs instead of dates, like '10m', which would be in 10 minutes.
13.  Add possibility to repeat indefinetly a reminder, like '202103120000 Birthday .repeat Y'. This will need a new emoji to cancel the reminder once it's been fired.
