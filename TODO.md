3.  Make it so no more reactions can be added.

5.  If reaction was from the original user, create new reminder for selected time.
6.  [Use Browserify](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html#browserify)
7.  Create branch `dev` to test code on it.
8.  Upload to Heroku and sync with branch `main`.
9.  Comment code
10.  Understand datatimes like '202102171410' but also '2102171410', '02171410', '171410', '1410'
11.  Add new possible inputs instead of dates, like '10m', which would be in 10 minutes.
